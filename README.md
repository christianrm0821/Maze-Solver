#Maze Generator and Solver

This Python project visualizes a maze and demonstrates how to solve it using Depth-First Search (DFS). Built with the tkinter library, it offers a simple graphical interface to showcase maze generation and solution.

Features
Maze Generation: Displays a randomly generated maze on a tkinter canvas.
Maze Solving: Implements DFS to find and visualize the solution path.
Graphical Visualization: Uses tkinter for an interactive display

#How It Works

##Maze Generation
The program initializes a grid and generates a maze displayed as a visual representation using the Canvas widget from tkinter.

##Maze Solving with DFS
Depth-First Search (DFS):
  Starts at the maze's entry point.
  Explores all paths recursively until reaching the exit.
  Marks visited nodes to avoid revisiting.
  Backtracks when necessary to find the correct path.
  The solution path is dynamically drawn on the canvas, showing how DFS navigates through the maze.
